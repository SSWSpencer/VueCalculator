# VueCalculator
A simple calculator app built with Vue

What can I say? It's a calculator. You've probably used one of them in your life before. Do I really need to say more? It's a calculator. I made it with Vue because I wanted to get some understanding of how to use this framework. You know what a calculator is, period. Full stop. I'm not going to patronize you.

_*sigh*_ Just because I know the only people who are ever going to look at this are future hiring managers who are going to be like "wow, the nerve of this guy to assume I know how a calculator works", let's assume you've never used one before and you need an explanation.

Welcome to your brand new tool of the future! Do you hate doing math? Do big numbers make you hide under your desk? Are you too good for long division, or "carrying the one"? Well I have a product for you! Introducing... the Calculator!

Simply enter a number, an operator, and any other number, and this tool will give you the result!

##### Features Included:
- Enter one number
- Enter an operator (so that you may enter another number)
- Enter another number
- From here you may either enter another operator to create a bigger math problem you are looking to solve (such as 5 * 5 / 25)
- When you're done entering numbers and operators, press the "=" button to get the result! 

##### Features Not Included:
- PEMDAS (your dear aunt sally was not excused)
- World peace

##### Features that we don't know for certain if they're included, but can't say for certain _aren't_ included:
- The cure to cancer
